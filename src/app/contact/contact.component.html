  <!--    The NgFor directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable.
          The context for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context
          with the given loop variable set to the current item from the iterable.
          https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html

          NgFor is a repeater directive â€” a way to customize data display.

          Our goal is to present a list of items. We define a block of HTML that
          defines how a single item should be displayed. We tell Angular to use
          that block as a template for rendering each item in the list.

  <span *ngIf="officeIsOpen">
   Our office is currently open, give us a call now.

  <span *ngIf="!officeIsOpen">
    We are closed now, but we'll be open again tomorrow.
